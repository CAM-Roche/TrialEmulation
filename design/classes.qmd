## Classes in TrialEmulation

Based on editor feedback we should improve our use of classes and methods.

Some easy things: - add print/show methods - add summary methods - make `trial_msm` take an object from `data_preparation()` (it does but it's said differently in the docs)

Some other things: - allow modularity and extensibility of classes and methods, eg alternative weight or outcome models

## Design

1.  input data object
2.  weight model class

-   censoring weights object
    -   fit_glm class
-   switching weights object
    -   fit_glm class

3.  data extension method

-   data output object: {data.table, csv, duckdb/sqlite}

4.  MSM model fit
5.  predict
