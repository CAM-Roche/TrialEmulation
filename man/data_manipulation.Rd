\arguments{
\item{data}{A \code{data.frame} containing all the required columns.}

\item{treatment}{Name of the data column for treatment feature Defaults to treatment}

\item{id}{Name of the data column for id feature Defaults to id}

\item{period}{Name of the data column for period feature Defaults to period}

\item{outcome}{Name of the data column for outcome feature Defaults to outcome}

\item{eligible}{Indicator of whether or not an observation is eligible to be expanded about Defaults to eligible}

\item{outcomeCov_var}{A list of individual baseline variables used in final model}

\item{cov_switchn}{List of covariates to be used in logistic model for switching probabilities for numerator model}

\item{model_switchn}{List of models (functions) to use the covariates from \code{cov_switchn}}

\item{class_switchn}{Class variables used in logistic model for nominator model}

\item{cov_switchd}{List of covariates to be used in logistic model for switching probabilities for denominator model}

\item{model_switchd}{List of models (functions) to use the covariates from \code{cov_switchd}}

\item{class_switchd}{Class variables used in logistic model for denominator model}

\item{first_period}{First period value to start expanding about}

\item{last_period}{Last period value to expand about}

\item{use_weight}{Use weights in analysis. If 0 then no weights will be calculated}

\item{use_censor}{Use censoring for per-protocol analysis - censor person-times once a person-trial stops taking the
initial treatment value}

\item{check_missing}{Check for missing values in final model when \code{use_censor=1} (Not added yet!)}

\item{cense}{Censoring variable}

\item{pool_cense}{Pool the numerator and denominator models (\code{0}: split models by previous treatment \code{Am1 = 0}
and \code{Am1 = 1} as in treatment models and \code{1}: pool all observations together into a single numerator and denominator
model) Defaults to \code{0}}

\item{cov_censed}{List of covariates to be used in logistic model for censoring weights in denominator model}

\item{model_censed}{List of models (functions) to use the covariates from \code{cov_censed}}

\item{class_censed}{Class variables used in censoring logistic regression in denominator model}

\item{cov_censen}{List of covariates to be used in logistic model for censoring weights in numerator model}

\item{model_censen}{List of models (functions) to use the covariates from \code{cov_censen}}

\item{class_censen}{Class variables used in censoring logistic regression in numerator model}

\item{include_regime_length}{If defined as \code{1} a new variable (\code{time_on_regime}) is added to dataset.
This variable stores the duration of time that the patient has been on the current treatment value}

\item{eligible_wts_0}{Eligibility criteria used in weights for model condition \code{Am1 = 0}}

\item{eligible_wts_1}{Eligibility criteria used in weights for model condition \code{Am1 = 1}}

\item{lag_p_nosw}{when \code{1} this will set the first weight to be 1 and use \code{p_nosw_d} and \code{p_nosw_n} at follow-up time
(t-1) for calculating the weights at follow-up time t.
Can be set to \code{0} which will increase the maximum and variance of weights (Defaults to 1)}

\item{where_var}{Variables used in where conditions used in subsetting the data
used in final analysis (\code{where_case}), the variables are not included in the final model.}

\item{data_dir}{Direction to save data}

\item{numCores}{Number of cores to be used for fitting weights (passed to \code{weight_func})}

\item{quiet}{Don't print progress messages.}
}
\description{
This function takes the data and all the variables and does the extension preprocessing and weight calculation.
