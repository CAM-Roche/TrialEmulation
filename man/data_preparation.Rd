the initial treatment value}

\item{check_missing}{Check for missing values in final model when use_censor=1 (Not added yet!)}

\item{cense}{Censoring variable}

\item{pool_cense}{Pool the numerator and denominator models (0: split models by previous treatment \code{Am1 = 0}
and Am1 = 1 as in treatment models and 1: pool all observations together into a single numerator and
denominator model) Defaults to 0}

\item{eligible_wts_1}{Eligibility criteria used in weights for model condition Am1 = 1}

\item{lag_p_nosw}{When 1 this will set the first weight to be 1 and use p_nosw_d and p_nosw_n at followup-time (t-1)
for calculating the weights at followup-time t - can be set to 0 which will increase the maximum and variance
of weights (Defaults to 1)}

(where_case), the variables not included in the final model}

\item{data_dir}{Direction to save data}

enough memory to expand the whole dataset at once. (default TRUE)}

faster but require more memory.}

\item{separate_files}{Write to one file or one per trial (default FALSE)}

\item{quiet}{Don't print progress messages.

\details{
The class variables parameters (\code{outcomeClass},\code{class_switchn},\code{class_switchd},\code{class_censen},
\code{class_censed}) can be given as a character vector which will construct factors using \code{as.factor} or as a named list
with the arguments for factor e.g.
\verb{list(risk_cat=list(levels = c(1,2,3,0), age_cat=list(levels=c(1,2,3),labels=c("50-60","60-70","70+")}
}
