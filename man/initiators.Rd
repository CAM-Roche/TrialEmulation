for calculating the weights at followup-time t - can be set to 0 which will increase the maximum and variance of
weights (Defaults to 1)}

\description{
This function analyses observational longitudinal data to estimate the effect of interventions sustained over time.
This emulates the design of a hypothetical randomized trial.

\details{
The class variables paramers (\code{outcomeClass},\code{class_switchn},\code{class_switchd},\code{class_censen},\code{class_censed})
can be given as a character vector which will construct factors using \code{as.factor} or as a named list with
the arguments for factor
eg \verb{list(risk_cat=list(levels = c(1,2,3,0), age_cat=list(levels=c(1,2,3),labels=c("50-60","60-70","70+")}
